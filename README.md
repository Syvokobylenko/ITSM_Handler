# ITSM_Handler
This is a program I wrote for my company, without any company data (all previous commits are removed).
Start with PyRegister.py (it's the only file that you can actually launch).
Other files don't work due to too dependence on company intranet and too much sensitive data removal.
This program is entirely written by me, except for folder "templates".
