# ITSM_Handler
This is a program I wrote for my company, without any company data (all previous commits are removed).<br />
Start with PyRegister.py (it's the only file that you can actually launch).<br />
Other files don't work due to too dependence on company intranet and too much sensitive data removal.<br />
This program is entirely written by me, except for folder "templates".<br />
